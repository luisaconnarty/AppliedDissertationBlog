<p>For the first four weeks of the project, we attended workshops led by a variety of lecturers and activities designed to familiarise us with the charity and spark our creativity. The aim was to inspire us to start envisioning our films - considering their message, impact, and the best way to communicate our ideas.
<br></br>
Ambika joined us as a representative from Pride Outside. She volunteers with the charity, primarily managing their social media, and has attended some of their workshops. Having Ambika involved in our creative process was invaluable, as she had knowledge of the charity that we didn’t and brought creative ideas to the project.
However, as Ambika had only been volunteering with Pride Outside for a short time, we still had many unanswered questions. We researched the charity’s social media and website to find out more, but to gain a deeper understanding, Jenny and I arranged to meet Lou and Ellis, the co-founders of Pride Outside. We prepared a list of questions in advance and met them for coffee, where they shared insights into their work and the mission behind the organisation.
<br></br>

<br></br>
This meeting was a turning point in the project. We learned about the different initiatives Pride Outside has been involved in and gained a clearer understanding of what Lou and Ellis wanted from the video. We learned about their past projects, the challenges they face - both financial and political - and what they actually wanted from the film. It wasn’t to recruit volunteers or service users, but to appeal to potential investors.
<br></br>
This was one of the few opportunities we had to interact with Lou and Ellis before filming, aside from a couple of Zoom calls. Our limited contact was partly due to their holiday absence throughout most of December and January, but mostly due to their busy workload and high demand. Additionally, while we were eager to engage more with the charity, there were few organised events, and Lou and Ellis preferred that we not attend in order to maintain a completely safe and inclusive space for participants.
Whilst I fully understood their reasoning, I believe that being more immersed in the charity and meeting more of the people connected to it would have deepened my understanding of their work and would have helped me feel more personally involved and better equipped to tell their story through the film. However, with the open space in the workshop to research and Lou and Ellis offering us lots of resources which they offer in their sessions, we managed to indirectly educate ourselves on Pride Outside and their ideals. In future projects I would hope to engage more with the organisation, but it is important to be aware and empathetic towards the potential for this not being possible.</p>

<p>Throughout pre-production, we collectively attempted to create a storyboard. Frances Higson, who led a couple of workshops, suggested creating a hypothetical script alongside the storyboard to help visualise the intended imagery. We were encouraged to do so to establish a clear narrative before filming, ensuring we had a structured plan rather than going in blindly.
<br></br>
Ambika, Jenny, and I spent several sessions trying to map things out, but it was trickier than expected. We had a strong vision - an emotional opening to show why Pride Outside is essential, followed by an introduction to the charity and ending with the impact it has made. But with interviews shaping the narrative, and uncertainty around who we’d actually be speaking to, predicting the structure in advance was difficult. 
Below are some basic storyboards we sketched, but notably nothing of great detail.</p>
<br></br>

<br></br>
Instead of a traditional storyboard, we took a different approach. We laid out a large piece of paper and brainstormed key elements - imagery, sounds, words, people, and questions - that we wanted to incorporate, noting anything that felt fitting. This exercise helped us establish a visual and thematic direction, particularly for B-roll footage, and also played a key role in shaping our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XGPJ7DJkJ97pAboVdlK_nwb29Croylc3?usp=share_link">interview questions</a>.

<br></br>
<p>Ultimately, we never completed a full storyboard. However, this did not negatively impact the project. We had a shared understanding of the film’s structure and aesthetic, keeping ideas organised in a group Google Drive and staying in regular contact via group chats. That said, in future projects, a structured storyboard would definitely help when working with a larger team, keeping things organised on shoot days, and making the editing process smoother.</p>

    <p>Practical workshops were also held to introduce us to the camera, sound equipment, and editing software. Following these sessions, we had the opportunity to film mock interviews and B-roll at the GMAC offices, allowing us to practise using the equipment in a hands-on setting.
    <br></br>
We practised setting up both static and handheld tripods, adjusting camera settings, and making modifications based on different filming conditions, such as lighting and focus. Additionally, we explored filming techniques like tracking shots and slow motion, emphasising the importance of clear communication between the camera operator and the grip, who ensures safety and assists with adjustments. These were also thoroughly enjoyable as everyone involved in the Applied Dissertation got the chance to work together and collaborate which did not happen often.</p>
<br></br>

<br></br>
At first, I found the influx of information overwhelming when learning to use the equipment. However, I quickly realised that the more I practised, the less daunting it became. The workshops were crucial in preparing us for real filming situations - especially for dealing with the time-consuming setup process.
<br></br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y_eZUBvyJ554svcKjpIsK6Gi0wFR0I63?usp=share_link">Here are some of the test shots</a>. Notably, Jenny and I filmed close-ups of our hands during a mock interview - a technique we were taught to enhance intimacy and emotion. Since we only had one camera, we decided against stopping and restarting interviews during filming to capture these shots. However, incorporating close-ups was something we considered in the planning stages and would have set-up if we had the extra resources.
<br></br>

Additionally, over the Christmas holidays, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7ODxpvSGe0SA0RKYF8cLh5qFZXvUnop/view?usp=sharing"<a>I filmed and edited this video to practice using DaVinci</a> whilst away. I did not end up finishing the video, but I found the process of editing it thoroughly helped refresh my understanding of how to import and organise files using DaVinci, while also refining my basic editing skills. Though it is a short video, I remember it taking me a long time to edit as I familiarised myself with different tools. The practice allowed me to explore different aspects of the software, finding many resources and tutorials online to help with any queries.
<br></br>
All in all, when it came to the equipment, it was a case of practice makes perfect - the more I used it, the less intimidating it became. Regardless going in to filming was a nerve-wrecking time!

 <p>The lead-up to filming was, without a doubt, the most stressful part of the process. Many factors contributed to this, such as the natural pressures of the limited filming days, and some unprecedented communication errors.
<br></br> 
Lou and Ellis kindly arranged interviewees from various organisations and secured a location, but things didn’t go entirely to plan. We initially had three interviews lined up with previous clients, but this was reduced to two – changing to completely different clients than we had previously expected. 
<br></br>
Our original clients included the chief officer of police Scotland and a dancer from Scottish ballet, understandably both holding high positions in their fields. Hence, due to us organising interviews around December and not filming until February, understandably other responsibilities came up that people had to attend to.
<br></br>
This last-minute change threw off our original B-roll plans, as they were related to the organisations we planned we would be interviewing. It was a lesson in the importance of communication and organisation - had known sooner, it wouldn’t have been such a scramble. Instead, with only a few days' notice, we had to secure new location release forms and rethink our B-roll ideas.
<br></br>
As a solution Jenny and I thought of how we could fill the gaps, we revisited <a href="https://youtu.be/OWHYSh9Btv0"<a>a promotional video Lou and Ellis had shown us</a> and encouraged us to use footage from, where people shared at the end what makes them feel proud. 
<br></br>
We had originally used this as inspiration and planned on including a section where we ask the interviewees ‘What makes you feel proud?’ and putting it towards the end of the film. However, since interviewee numbers had dropped, we decided to extend the idea to the wider community - creating a submission box for people to write down their responses, which we would then additionally incorporate into the end of the film.
<br></br>
<img src="images/poster.jpeg" alt="poster alongside box" height="670" width="500" allign="center"><img src="images/pre4.jpeg" alt="in the library with our what makes you feel proud box" height="=500" width="500" allign="center">
<br></br>
We collected plenty of responses, but in the end, the idea didn’t make the final cut as we felt the responses did not completely fit the tone of the final video. The experience was a valuable reminder that, when collaborating, things don’t always go as planned. Flexibility is key, and sometimes, the best approach is to adapt, rethink, and move forward.
<br><br>
</p>Notably, throughout the project, I found inspiration from many things around me. Related to this section, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uer5Kuab2WypPtLzjNR-KzG-ty9tUDo-/view?usp=sharing"<a>a film I saw </a> at an exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art in New York by Robert Frank really stood out. It thoroughly entertained me and reaffirmed the idea of including the "What Makes You Proud" section. I really liked the humour and the unique personality each person brought to the film. I felt that including something similar would add a strong sense of community and make the piece feel more personal and emotionally captivating. We were both upset when the concept didn't go ahead in the end, but we found the responses we got both on paper and in the interviews did not work for what we had envisioned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of Pride Outside’s outdoor welfare events, which they host for the queer community, fell within our filming window. This was a bit of a disappointment, as attending one of these events would have given us a chance to capture the energy and community that their work fosters in real time.</p>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<p>However, we came across the image above on their Instagram that was taken from one of their welfare events. It showed pride flags and colourful buntings strung between trees in a forest, creating a quiet but powerful celebration of identity and belonging in nature. We decided to recreate this scene as a way of visually representing what Pride Outside stands for as well as showing what to expect from attending an event with them.</p>

<p>Using that photo as a reference, we set up our own mini Pride festival in the woods. This shoot ended up producing some of my favourite footage from the project. It beautifully captured the essence of Pride Outside: joy, community, and the reclaiming of outdoor spaces as safe, inclusive environments for queer people. It also served as meaningful B-roll that added depth and symbolism to the narrative we were building.</p>
<br></br>
<p>While being at a real event would have added a more personal and direct connection to the people involved in the social enterprise, we were fortunate to have access to some archival footage that filled in those gaps. Looking back and in the moment, I think attending an actual Pride Outside event would have be an amazing opportunity - not only for the footage but to engage more deeply with the community and the impact of the work being done. We were lucky however to have the archival footage to further demonstrate the welfare side of what Pride Outside offers.</p>

<p>In terms of post-production, Jenny and I worked closely together throughout the entire editing process. Since we were creating a documentary-style film without a pre-written script, our first major challenge was shaping a narrative from the dialogue captured in our interviews. We wanted the final piece to reflect the story we'd initially envisioned in our storyboards, but we had to find that story organically through the material.</p>
<br></br>
<p>To begin, we transcribed all of the interviews and printed them out. We then went through each transcription, picking out moments that felt meaningful, insightful, or emotionally resonant. From there, we began grouping these quotes into roughly nine thematic categories, ranging from ‘Introductions’ and ‘Nature’ to more emotionally charged ones like ‘Shit is Getting Bad.’ 
Once we had our categories, we rearranged them into a loose narrative structure, deciding how we wanted the story to unfold. In DaVinci Resolve, we marked out each section with placeholders to keep the structure clear and organised.</p>
<img src="images/highlight.jpeg" alt="screenshot from instagram story of event promotion. Image contains pride flags stroon across a forest setting" height="700" width="700"> 
<br></br>
<p>From roughly three hours of interview footage, the initial rough cut was around 16 minutes long and essentially a series of talking heads with hard cuts between sections. As we continued refining, the edit gradually came down to 10 minutes, then 6, and eventually the final cut landed just under 5 minutes. Along the way, we learned that not everything we’d highlighted was necessary, and that visual storytelling could sometimes speak louder than words. Rather than having a talking head explain a concept, we realised certain moments could be conveyed just as effectively, if not more so, through imagery.</p> 
<br></br>
<p>Regular feedback from Lou and Ellis was invaluable throughout this process. Their input helped us fully lock into the tone they were looking for; something celebratory and uplifting. This meant letting go of some of the more emotional and political content we’d initially included. While it was difficult to cut certain segments we felt strongly about, their guidance helped us focus the piece and remain true to the spirit of the brief.</p>
 <img src="images/feedback1.jpeg" alt="feedback" height="700" width="700"> <img src="images/emailfeedback.jpeg" alt="feedback" height="700" width="700"> 
<br></br>
<p>I found the method of transcribing and grouping sections to be incredibly effective. It allowed Jenny and I to easily refer back to specific moments without having to sift through hours of footage each time we wanted to locate a particular quote or idea. This approach saved us a significant amount of time and helped keep the editing process organised and focused. In future projects, I would absolutely use the same method again. It streamlined our workflow and made it much easier to build the narrative with intention, rather than getting lost in the volume of raw material.</p>

<p>Overall, this project exceeded my expectations in so many ways. Working in a real-world setting gave me the opportunity to develop both professionalism and practical skills, especially as we were aiming to create a video that Pride Outside would actually use and benefit from. That goal really shaped our approach and gave the work real purpose.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Upon reflection, I also gained a deeper understanding of the third sector and the challenges that come with operating within it. Although we didn’t have a huge amount of contact time with the charity, we came to understand why - Pride Outside is essentially run by just Lou and Ellis, managing everything themselves. That insight made us realise how valuable our support could be. Producing a film is something they simply wouldn’t have the time or resources for otherwise, so our involvement felt especially meaningful in the current climate.</p>
<br></br>
<p>We also learned that the absence of welfare events during our filming period wasn’t a coincidence but a reflection of the ongoing funding issues in the sector. Much of the charity’s energy has to go into the corporate side of things just to keep the organisation afloat. That context made our work feel even more impactful, as we were helping to amplify the message of a group that’s doing incredibly important work with limited support.</p>
<br></br>
<p>So, not only have I gained valuable interpersonal and technical skills from this experience, but I’ve also developed a much greater awareness of what it means to work in the third sector. Hearing directly from Ambika, and through Kieran - one of our interviewees - about the real-life impact Pride Outside has had on people’s lives made me incredibly proud. I’m grateful to have played a part in creating a piece of media that promotes such a positive, affirming cause.</p>
